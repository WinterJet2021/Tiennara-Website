            <p>Tiennara is more than just a luxurious getaway; it is a place steeped in history and cultural significance.
                 The name "Tiennara" is derived from the ancient term for "Heavenly Shore,"
                  reflecting the idyllic and serene nature of the location. 
                Originally, Tien Beach was a hidden gem known only to locals and a few intrepid travelers.
                 The area was historically a fishing village, with a community that lived in harmony with the sea.
                  Over time, as word of its beauty spread, Tien Beach became a coveted destination for those seeking a peaceful retreat.
